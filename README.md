# **P-Capyrus**
## ***Next Generation Policy-as-Code***

An easy-to-use prototype that parses English-language prompts detailing information and network security policy and translates them into series of packet-capture (PCAP) expressions as conjoined literals.

Built as a 2023 SURF Project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the federal government. It is a soon-to-be open-sourced project on GitHub with the goal of semi-automatically enforcing all cybersecurity policy pertaining to Layers 3 & 4 network traffic.

Currently a work in progress by [@Awildanthony](https://github.com/Awildanthony).

Documentation is being continually drafted alongside development of the web application, as well as additional support for the translation tool.
